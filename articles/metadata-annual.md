# Metadata for annual key measures

> **Note:** This package currently only provides metadata for the most
> recent annual reporting period. Not all annual measures from the table
> below are currently available in the tidy data provided by this
> package - there are some inconsistencies across the years that we need
> to investigate first. We plan to implement all available measures for
> all years in the future.

## Measures

The following table shows all available measures in the most recent
annual key measures dataset.

## Breakdowns

### Organisational

The following table shows the standard organisational columns available
for all breakdowns.

### Demographic, clinical, and treatment delivery

The following table shows all available demographic, clinical, and
treatment delivery variables for breakdowns.

These three columns provide further options for breakdowns:

- `VariableType`: The type of variable by which the data are
  categorised.
- `VariableA`: The high-level variable values for the categories
- `VariableB`: The sub-category (where applicable - NULL if not
  applicable)
